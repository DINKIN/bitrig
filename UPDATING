xlocale support has been merged from FreeBSD, this requires some special
build steps (or update from a snap)

It is very important to be running a recent kernel.  Make certain the kernel
is based from source more recent than 6 Apr 2014

Then follow these build steps (as root):
(it appears that 'make buildworld' twice would also suffice)


(cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install)
(cd /usr/src && make obj)
(cd /usr/src && make includes )
(cd /usr/src/libexec/ld.so && SKIPDIR="ldd ldconfig" make depend && \
    SKIPDIR="ldd ldconfig" make &&\
    SKIPDIR="ldd ldconfig" NOMAN=1 make install)
(cd /usr/src/lib/csu && make depend && make && NOMAN=1 make install)
(cd /usr/src/lib/libc && make depend && make && NOMAN=1 make install)

(cd /usr/src/usr.bin/mklocale && make depend && make && make install)
(cd /usr/src/share/locale && make depend && make && make install)

(cd /usr/src && make build)
