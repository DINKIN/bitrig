The current C++ standard library, GNU libstdc++, has been replaced
by a combination of libc++ and libc++abi.  This requires some special
build steps (or update from a snap)

It is very important to be running a recent system, as this change is
based on the xlocale support.  If you don't use a snap, you should build
and install all packages after the following steps, as the upgrade process
will delete them

Then follow these steps (as root):


(cd /usr/src && make buildworld)
(cd /usr/ports/bitrig/bitrig-llvm && make install)
(cd /usr/ports/bitrig/bitrig-gcc && make install)
(cd /usr/src && make buildworld)
(cd /usr/xenocara && make buildworld)
pkg_delete -IX bitrig-syscomp
rm -rf /usr/ports/packages/*
(cd /usr/ports/meta/bitrig-syscomp && CLEANDEPENDS=yes make clean && \
  FORCE_UPDATE=hard make package)

xlocale support has been merged from FreeBSD, this requires some special
build steps (or update from a snap)

It is very important to be running a recent kernel.  Make certain the kernel
is based from source more recent than 6 Apr 2014

Then follow these build steps (as root):
(it appears that 'make buildworld' twice would also suffice)


(cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install)
(cd /usr/src && make obj)
(cd /usr/src && make includes)
(cd /usr/src/libexec/ld.so && SKIPDIR="ldd ldconfig" make depend && \
    SKIPDIR="ldd ldconfig" make &&\
    SKIPDIR="ldd ldconfig" NOMAN=1 make install)
(cd /usr/src/lib/csu && make depend && make && NOMAN=1 make install)
(cd /usr/src/lib/libc && make depend && make && NOMAN=1 make install)

(cd /usr/src/usr.bin/mklocale && make depend && make && make install)
(cd /usr/src/share/locale && make depend && make && make install)

(cd /usr/src && make build)
