This file contains special operations that are required to update past flag
days in the system. Any pertinent sections between the current version of your
system and the current day should be read before operation and performed either
before or after the update, depending on the instructions in the individual
steps.

If you are unsure of the date of your current system snapshot, the build date
and git commit SHA of the kernel are included in the copyright message printed
at the beginning of the kernel dmesg(8).

  /var/tmp is now a symlink to /tmp. If you're compiling from source, the
  symlink has to be manually created.

  As root:

	# rm -r /var/tmp
	# ln -s /tmp /var/tmp
