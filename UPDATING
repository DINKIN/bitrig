This file contains special operations that are required to update past flag
days in the system. Any pertinent sections between the current version of your
system and the current day should be read before operation and performed either
before or after the update, depending on the instructions in the individual
steps.

If you are unsure of the date of your current system snapshot, the build date
and git commit SHA of the kernel are included in the copyright message printed
at the beginning of the kernel dmesg(8).

* 2015-08-03: amd64 goes PIE
* 2015-02-28: clang 3.6.0
* 2015-01-23: vnd encryption support removed

* 2015-08-03: amd64 goes PIE

  The amd64 architecture has been moved to position-independent executables.

  It is recommended to follow this change by upgrading to a newer snapshot.
  If you prefer to manually re-build the system, please follow these
  instructions step by step. These instructions have to be run as root.

  It is assumed that a current source checkout is stored in /usr/src. A
  current ports checkout is stored in /usr/ports.

  First you need to make amd64 known as PIE architecture:

	# cd /usr/src/share/mk/
	# make install

  Build clang, but do not install it yet:

	# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/clang/
	# make bootstrap

  Compile binutils from ports and install it.

	# cd /usr/ports/bitrig/bitrig-binutils/
	# make install

  Install clang.

	# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/clang/
	# make install

  Update System V ABI.

	# cd /usr/src/lib/csu/
	# make depend && make -j4 && make install

  You can then proceed to rebuild your system as usual.

* 2015-07-29: clang 3.6.2

  Clang has been updated from 3.6.0 to 3.6.2. As a result of that change
  the headers are installed into a new directory. The old headers have to
  be removed manually after upgrading.

  As root:

	# rm -r /usr/lib/clang/3.6.0

* 2015-02-28: clang 3.6.0

  Clang has been updated from 3.4.2 to 3.6.0. As a result of that change
  the headers are installed into a new directory. The old headers have to
  be removed manually after upgrading.

  As root:

	# rm -r /usr/lib/clang/3.4.2

* 2015-01-23: vnd encryption support removed

  The encryption support in vnd(4) was obsolete and has been removed. Please
  consider using softraid(4) with the CRYPTO discipline instead. Also the
  [-kKS] flags, which are related to vnd encryption, have been removed from
  vnconfig.

* 2015-01-02: clang 3.4.2

  Clang has been updated from 3.4.0 to 3.4.2. As a result of that change
  the headers are installed into a new directory. The old headers have to
  be removed manually after upgrading.

  As root:

	# rm -r /usr/lib/clang/3.4

* 2014-12-29: /var/tmp

  /var/tmp is now a symlink to /tmp. If you're compiling from source, the
  symlink has to be manually created.

  As root:

	# rm -r /var/tmp
	# ln -s /tmp /var/tmp
